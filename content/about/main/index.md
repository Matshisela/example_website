  I specialize in:
  
  ✔ Data Analysis & Visualization – Extracting actionable insights using R, Python, and SPSS.
  
  ✔ Statistical & Predictive Modeling – Building machine learning models to solve complex business challenges.
  
  ✔ Data Storytelling – Communicating technical findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
  
  ✔ End-to-End Data Solutions – From data preprocessing to model deployment, ensuring accuracy and impact.

  When I’m not crunching numbers, I enjoy mentoring aspiring data professionals, contributing to open-source projects, and exploring AI advancements. My goal is to leverage data for positive change—whether in business, research, or social impact initiatives.

  Let’s connect! Whether you’re looking for collaboration, consulting, or just a data-driven conversation, I’d love to hear from you.
